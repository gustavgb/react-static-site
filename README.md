# react-static-site

My first stab at creating a static site generator for react. Sharing this, in case anyone faces the same problem.

## How to use

Modify or add files in **src/pages**. These are the main routes that will be compiled. Then run:

`yarn && yarn start`

You should now able to visit *localhost:5000* where index.js (index.html) is served.

If you wish to, feel free to complete my work ðŸ˜Ž
